= Application is inaccessible externally

== Scenario

The application runs on a virtual machine `exercise3` and is intended to be accessible externally through link:https://exercise3-namespace-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io[https://exercise3-namespace-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io^], but itâ€™s currently facing connectivity issues.

NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the issue by examining the OpenShift network components involved in accessing the application within the OpenShift cluster.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.SSH command to bastion
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
----

.bastion Password
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{bastion_ssh_password}
----

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise3
----

=== Console
After the break, you can log in to the OpenShift web console using your username and password or continue using the `oc` Command line at bastion to begin the troubleshooting process.
