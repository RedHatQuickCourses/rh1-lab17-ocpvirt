= The application is not accessible externally

== Scenario

The application is running on a virtual machine `exercise3` and is intended to be accessible externally through https://exercise3-namespace-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io, but itâ€™s currently facing connectivity issues. 
The objective of this exercise is to identify the root cause of the problem checking the OpenShift network components used to access an application on the OpenShift cluster.

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal on right side, access SSH the node bastion.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access SSH the node bastion if you are not connected.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
```

Once connected to the bastion host run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise3
