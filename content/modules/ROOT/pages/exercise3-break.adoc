[#scenario]
= The application is not accessible externally

== Scenario

The application is running on a virtual machine `exercise3` and is intended to be accessible externally through link:https://exercise3-namespace-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io[https://exercise3-namespace-{user}.apps.cluster-{guid}.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io^], but itâ€™s currently facing connectivity issues.

NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the issue by examining the OpenShift network components involved in accessing the application within the OpenShift cluster.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise3
----
