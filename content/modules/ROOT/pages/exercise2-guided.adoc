NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to get `exercise2` virtual machine back into the `Running` state.

The steps to fix exercise2 are:

=== Console

1. Login to Openshift console using the assigned user account

2. Go to Virtualization - Virtual Machines and check the VM status.

[start=3]
3. Check the Virtual Machine is failing with error `ErrorUnschedulable`.

[start=4]
4. Go to tab `YAML` and check the status of the Virtual Machine. It is failing with error message: 

[source]
----
message: '0/6 nodes are available: 3 node(s) didn''t match Pod''s node affinity/selector, 3 node(s) had untolerated taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }. preemption: 0/6 nodes are available: 6 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.'
----

[start=5]
5. Check the `NodeSelector` and `Tolerations` assigned to this virtual machine. 

[source, yaml]
----
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/baremetal: ''
    tolerations:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: bare_metal
        value: 'true'
----

[start=6]
6. These `NodeSelectors` and `Tolerations` refer to nodes that do not match those in the cluster. Remove them.

[start=7]
7. Restart the virtual machine to apply the changes. 


[start=8]
8. Wait for the virtual machine to start and check that now the virtual machine is in `Running` state.

== Command Line (CLI)

1. Login to Openshift server API using the assigned user account with `oc` command if not logged in.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to the assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
----

[start=3]
3. Check there is a virtual machine running in this namespace and its status. The output should be similar to the following one: 

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get pod,vm
----

----
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/exercise2   20s   ErrorUnschedulable   False
----

[start=4]
4. Check which the the Virtual Machine status to get more details about the error:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc describe vm exercise2

5. Inspect the virtual machine and check the `NodeSelector` and `Tolerations` assigned to this virtual machine. 

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vm exercise1 -oyaml
----

[source, yaml]
----
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/baremetal: ''
    tolerations:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: bare_metal
        value: 'true'
----

[start=6]
6. These `NodeSelectors` and `Tolerations` refer to nodes that do not match those in the cluster. Edit the virtual machine configuration file and remove them.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc edit vm exercise1 
----

[start=7]
7. Restart the virtual machine

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl restart exercise1
----

[start=8]
8. Wait until the virtual machine is started and make sure it is in running state

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get pod,vm
----

----
