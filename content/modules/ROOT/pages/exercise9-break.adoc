[#scenario]
= The VM doesn't stop when shutdown is run inside the guest OS

== Scenario

The virtual machine does not stay powered off after the user executes a `shutdown -h now` command within the guest OS. A few seconds after the shutdown process completes, the virtual machine automatically powers back on.

NOTE: You need to modify the Virtual Machine configuration to ensure it remains in a stopped state after shutdown using guest OS.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access the bastion node using SSH if you are not connected yet.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

Once connected to the bastion host run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise9
----
