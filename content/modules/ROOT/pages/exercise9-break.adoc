[#scenario]
= The VM doesn't stop when shutdown is run inside the guest OS

== Scenario

The virtual machine `exercise9` does not remain powered off after the user executes the `shutdown -h now` command within the guest operating system. Instead, it powers back on automatically a few seconds after the shutdown process completes.

NOTE: You need to modify the Virtual Machine configuration to ensure it remains in a stopped state after shutdown using guest OS.
