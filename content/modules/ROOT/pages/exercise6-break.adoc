=  Live Migration failed

== Scenario

The user is attempting to migrate a virtual machine from one node to another using live migration.

NOTE: The primary goal is to investigate the cause of the live migration failure and take corrective action to successfully migrate the `exercise6` virtual machine to another node. Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host log in OCP cluster

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

run the command to break the lab

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
