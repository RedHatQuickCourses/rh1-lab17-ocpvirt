= Virtual Machine is not scheduling - part 2

== Scenario

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise2` virtual machine online again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access SSH the node bastion if you are not connected yet.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
```

Once connected to the bastion host run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise2
```
