NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to get `exercise2` virtual machine back into the `Running` state.

Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]

{bastion_ssh_password}
----

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

=== Console
After the break, you can log in to the OpenShift web console using your username and password or continue using the `oc` Command line at bastion to begin the troubleshooting process.
