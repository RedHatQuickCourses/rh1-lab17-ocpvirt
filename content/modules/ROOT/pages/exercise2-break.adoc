NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to get `exercise2` virtual machine back into the `Running` state.

Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the OCP cluster, run the command to break the lab.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise2
----

=== Console
After the break, you can log in to the OpenShift web console using your username and password or continue using the `oc` Command line at bastion to begin the troubleshooting process.
