NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to get `exercise2` virtual machine back into the `Running` state.

Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_port}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.
