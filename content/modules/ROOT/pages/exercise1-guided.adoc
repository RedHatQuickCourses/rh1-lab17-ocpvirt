[#fix]
= Fix Virtual Machine is not starting

== Scenario

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine online again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access SSH the node `{bastion_public_hostname}` using `userX` (where X is the number of your user) 

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
{login_command}
```

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
```

Once connected to the bastion host run the command lab to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise1
```
