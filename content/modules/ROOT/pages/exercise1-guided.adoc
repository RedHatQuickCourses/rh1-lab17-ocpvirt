= Fix Virtual Machine is not starting

The user is trying to start the VM but the process failed to execute successfully.

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.

Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

The steps to fix the exercise1 are:

.Console
----
1. Login to Openshift console using the assigned user account
2. Go to virtualization - virtual machine - look for VM status
3. Check the error status
4. Go to tab yaml and look for spec.domain.memory.guest
5. Replace the memory below 128Gi, example for 8Gi
6. Restart the virtual machine
7. Wait and make sure the vm is in running state
----

.CLI
----
1. Login to Openshift server api using the assigned user account
2. Go to assigned namespace (oc project namespace-{{ user }})
3. Check vm status (oc get pod,vm)
4. Check the vm error status (oc describe vm name)
5. Edit the vm yaml (oc edit {{ vm name }})
6. Restart the virtual machine
7. Wait and make sure the vm is in running state (oc get vm,pod)
