= Fix Virtual Machine is not starting

The user is trying to start the VM but the process failed to execute successfully.

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.

Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

The steps to fix the exercise1 are:

=== Console

1. Login to OpenShift console using the assigned user account.

2. Go to Virtualization - Virtual Machines and check the VM status.

[start=3]
3. Check the Virtual Machine is failing with error `ErrorUnschedulable`.

[start=4]
4. Go to tab `YAML` and check the status of the Virtual Machine. It is failing with error message: 

[source]
----
message: '0/6 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient memory, 3 node(s) had untolerated taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }. preemption: 0/6 nodes are available: 3 No preemption victims found for incoming pod, 3 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.'
----

[start=5]
5. Check the memory assigned for the Virtual Machine in the field `spec.domain.memory.guest`.


[source, yaml]
----
        memory:
          guest: 128Gi
----

[start=6]
6.  Edit the `yaml` file to change the assigned value to one lower than 128Gi.

[source, yaml]
----
        memory:
          guest: 8Gi
----

[start=7]
7. Save the updated configuration file and restart the virtual machine.

[start=8]
8. Wait for the virtual machine to start and check that now the virtual machine is in `Running` state.

=== CLI

1. Login to Openshift server API using the assigned user account with `oc` command if not logged in.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to the assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
----

[start=3]
3. Check there is a virtual machine running in this namespace and its status. The output should be similar to the following one: 

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get pod,vm
----

----
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

NAME                                   AGE   STATUS               READY
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/exercise1   85m   ErrorUnschedulable   False
----

[start=4]
4. Check which the the Virtual Machine status to get more details about the error:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc describe vm exercise1

5. Inspect the virtual machine and check the memory assigned to it in the field `spec.domain.memory.guest`.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vm exercise1 -oyaml
----

[source, yaml]
----
        memory:
          guest: 128Gi
----


[start=6]
6. Edit the virtual machine to assign a value lower than 128Gi.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc edit vm exercise1
----

[source, yaml]
----
        memory:
          guest: 8Gi
----

[start=7]
7. Restart the virtual machine

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl restart exercise1
----

[start=8]
8. Wait until the virtual machine is started and make sure it is in running state

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get pod,vm
