[#fix]
= The VM doesn't stop when shutdown is run inside the guest OS

== Scenario

The virtual machine `exercise9` does not remain powered off after the user executes the `shutdown -h now` command within the guest operating system. Instead, it powers back on automatically a few seconds after the shutdown process completes.

NOTE: You need to modify the Virtual Machine configuration to ensure it remains in a stopped state after shutdown using guest OS.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise
----

=== Console

1. Login to OpenShift console using the assigned user account.

link:{openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url}^]

.Username
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----

.Password
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to virtualization - virtual machine - select project for the assigned user account - look for VM status

#TODO

=== Command line (CLI)

1. Login to Openshift server API using the assigned user account with `oc` command if not logged in.

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to the assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
----

[start=3]
3. List the virtual machines

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vm
----


[start=4]
4. Shutdown the virtual machine using OS command

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl ssh lab-user@exercise9 \
--command 'sudo shutdown -h now'
----

[start=5]
5. Check the virtual machine stopped and started again after a few seconds

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vm
----

[start=6]
6. Edit the virtual machine and change runStrategy from `always` to `manual`

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc edit vm exercise9
----

[start=7]
7. Shutdown the virtual machine using OS command again

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl ssh lab-user@exercise9 \
--command 'sudo shutdown -h now'
----

[start=8]
8. Check the virtual machine still stopped

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vm
----
