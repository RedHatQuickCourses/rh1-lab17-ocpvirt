[#fix]
= The VM doesn't stop when shutdown is run inside the guest OS

== Scenario

The virtual machine does not stay powered off after the user executes a `shutdown -h now` command within the guest OS. A few seconds after the shutdown process completes, the virtual machine automatically powers back on.

NOTE: You need to modify the Virtual Machine configuration to ensure it remains in a stopped state after shutdown using guest OS.

The steps to fix exercise9 are:

== Console
----
1. Login to Openshift console using the assigned user account
2. Go to virtualization - virtual machine - select project for the assigned user account - look for VM status

== Command Line (CLI)

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]

[start=2]
2. Go to the assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
