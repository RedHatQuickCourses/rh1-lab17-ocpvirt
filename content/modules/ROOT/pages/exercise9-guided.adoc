[#fix]
= The VM doesn't stop when shutdown is run inside the guest OS

== Scenario

The virtual machine `exercise9` is not powered off after the user executes a `shutdown -h now` command within the guest OS. A few seconds after the shutdown process, it automatically powers back on.

NOTE: You need to modify the Virtual Machine configuration to ensure it remains in a stopped state after shutdown using guest OS.

The steps to fix exercise9 are:
