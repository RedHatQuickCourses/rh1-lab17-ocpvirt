= Virtual Machine snapshot restore buttons are grayed out

== Scenario

In this scenario, a Virtual Machine named `exercise7` is currently in the `Running` state and has an existing snapshot the user wants to restore. However, the user has noticed that the snapshot's buttons are grayed out, making it impossible to proceed with the restoration.

Your task is to investigate the steps taken by the user to restore the snapshot and resolve the issue.

NOTE: The objective is to successfully restore the snapshot of the Virtual Machine `exercise7`.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_password}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.
