[#scenario]
= Two virtual machines need to be able to communicate with each other.

== Scenario

The virtual machines `exercise11-a` and `exercise11-b` are up and running with their IP addresses configured. However, communication between them is not functioning as expected.

NOTE: Your task is to troubleshoot why is the VM are not communicating and resolve it.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise11
----
