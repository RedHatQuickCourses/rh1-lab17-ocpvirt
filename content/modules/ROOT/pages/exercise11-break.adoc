* Your task is to identify and troubleshoot the issue preventing communication between the VMs. Resolve it to restore connectivity.
* You can recreate any virtual machine if needed
* Do not edit nothing inside the guest OS

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_port}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.SSH command to Bastion
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
----

.Bastion Password
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{bastion_ssh_password}
----

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise11

=== Console
After completing the break, you can access the OpenShift web console using the username and password.
