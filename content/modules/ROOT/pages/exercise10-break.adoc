Your task is to troubleshoot why is the VM did not assigned the IP automatically when VM running and resolve it.

NOTE: The VM only need to use 1 network interface and from the requirement no need to assign static IP address. 

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access the bastion node using SSH if you are not connected yet.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

Once connected to the bastion host run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise 10
----
