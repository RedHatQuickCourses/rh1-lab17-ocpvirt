Your task is to troubleshoot why is the VM did not assigned the IP automatically when VM running and resolve it.

NOTE: The VM only need to use 1 network interface and from the requirement no need to assign static IP address. 

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise10
----
