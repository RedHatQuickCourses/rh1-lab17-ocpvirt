[NOTE]

* Your task is to identify and troubleshoot the issue preventing communication between the VMs. Resolve it to restore connectivity.
* A `network-attachment-definition` `br-ex-network` is created on `namespace-{user}`

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise10
----
