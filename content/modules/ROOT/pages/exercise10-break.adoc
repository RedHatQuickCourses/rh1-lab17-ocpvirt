== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_password}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
