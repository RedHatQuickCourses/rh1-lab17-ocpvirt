= Live Migration failed

== Scenario

Using `live migration`, the user is attempting to migrate a virtual machine from one node to another.

NOTE: The primary goal is to investigate the cause of the live migration failure and take corrective action to successfully migrate the `exercise6` virtual machine to another node. Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

The steps to fix exercise6 are:

=== Console

1. Login to OpenShift console using the assigned user account.

2. Go to Virtualization - VirtualMachines - Select the project for the assigned user account - look for VM called `exercise6`.

[start=3]
3. Open the Virtual Machine `exercise6` to get its details.

[start=4]
4. Try to migrate the virtual machine using Live Migration. Migration is going to fail.

[start=5]
5. Examine the logs of the `virt-launcher-exercise6` pod to identify the root cause. 

** Go to the project for the assigned user account and then look for the failed pod.

** Check the pod logs. The issue occurs because the virtual machine disks are configured as read-only, preventing migration.

6. Stop the virtual machine to edit its configuration.

[start=7]
7. Edit the virtual machine and remove the fields `readonly: true` from the VM disks. Go to the `YAML` section and change the field `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.disks.readonly` to false.

8. Start again the virtual machine. Check the node where the virtual machine is placed.

10. The virtual machine should be migrated to another node successfully.

=== CLI

1. Login to Openshift server API using the assigned user account with `oc` command if not logged in.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to the assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
----

[start=3]
3. Check there is a virtual machine running in this namespace. The output should be similar to the following one: 

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vmi
----

----
NAME        AGE   PHASE     IP            NODENAME                 READY
exercise6   11m   Running   10.132.2.46   worker-cluster-1   True
----

[start=4]
4. Migrate the virtual machine using the `virtctl` command.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl migrate exercise6
----

[start=5]
5. Check the migration status by retreiving the `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object. The output should indicate that the migration is in the `Failed` phase.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get VirtualMachineInstanceMigration 
----

----
NAME                        PHASE    VMI
kubevirt-migrate-vm   Failed   exercise6
----

[start=6]
6. Stop the virtual machine.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl stop exercise6
----

[start=7]
7. Edit the virtual machine and remove the fields `readonly: true` from the VM disks. Change the field `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.disks.readonly` to false.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc edit vm exercise6
----


[source, yaml]

              name: rootdisk
            - disk:
                bus: virtio

              name: cloudinitdisk
          interfaces:
----

[start=8]
8. Start again the virtual machine.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl start exercise6
----

[start=9]
9. Check the node where the virtual machine is placed.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vmi
----

----
NAME        AGE   PHASE     IP            NODENAME                 READY

----

[start=10]
10. Migrate the virtual machine. 

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl migrate exercise6
----

[start=11]
11. Check the migration status by retreiving the `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object. Now, the output should indicate that the migration is in the `Succeeded` phase.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get VirtualMachineInstanceMigration 
----

----

----

[start=12]
12. Check the node where the vortual machine is now placed

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc get vmi
----

----
