= Enabling VM communication - Part 3

== Scenario

The virtual machines `exercise12-a` and `exercise12-b` are up and running with their IP addresses configured properly. 
However, `exercise12-a` virtual machine does not have access to the application that is running on port 80 on virtual machine `exercise12-b`

[NOTE]
====
* Your task is to identify and troubleshoot the issue preventing communication between the VMs. 
* Resolve it to restore connectivity on port 80.
*  The `subnet` is defined on `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions`, and you must check the virtual machines IP addresses

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.SSH command to bastion
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
