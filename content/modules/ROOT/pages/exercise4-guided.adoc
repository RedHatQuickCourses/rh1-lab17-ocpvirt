[#fix]
= Virtual Machine with performance degraded

== Scenario

In this scenario, a Virtual Machine named `exercise4` is currently in a `running` state. The development team has reported performance issues with an application hosted on this VM.

Your task is to investigate the problem by analyzing the VMâ€™s resource usage, including CPU, memory, and other relevant metrics. You are permitted to adjust the VM's compute resources as needed to resolve the issue; however, a reboot is not permitted.

[NOTE]
====
* The goal is to identify bottlenecks or misconfigurations and implement optimizations to enhance the application's efficiency within the virtualized infrastructure.
* Do not kill any process running inside the virtual machine
* Do not reboot the virtual machine
* The amount of CPU available for the virtual machine in this lab is 4.
====

The steps to fix exercise4 are:

=== Console

1. Login to OpenShift console using the assigned user account.

=== What you learned

In this exercise, you learned that when working with a RHEL 9 virtual machine, there is no need to shut down or reboot the VM to modify the CPU configuration. 
Instead, you can perform a CPU hotplug operation while the VM is running.
Even without using it in this exercise, it's possible to perform memory hotplug without rebooting the virtual machine as well.
