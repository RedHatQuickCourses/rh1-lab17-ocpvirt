[#fix]
= Virtual Machine with performance degraded

== Scenario

In this scenario, a Virtual Machine named `exercise4` is currently in a Running state. The development team has reported performance issues with an application hosted on this VM.

Your task is to investigate the problem by analyzing the VMâ€™s resource usage, including CPU, memory, and other relevant metrics. You are permitted to adjust the VM's compute resources as needed to resolve the issue; however, a reboot is not permitted.

NOTE: The goal is to identify bottlenecks or misconfigurations and implement optimizations to enhance the application's efficiency within the virtualized infrastructure.

The steps to fix exercise4 are:

=== Console

1. Login to OpenShift console using the assigned user account.

link:{openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url}^]

.Username
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----

.Password
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}
----

[start=2]
2. Go to Virtualization - VirtualMachines - Select the project for the assigned user account - look for VM called `exercise4`.

++++
</a>
++++

[start=3]
3. Go to Virtual Machine details and check the resources being consumed.

++++
</a>
++++

4. In the new browser tab - check the error status (The application is currently not serving requests at this endpoint. It may not have been started or is still starting.)
5. Go to Network - Services - Check exercise3 services - Look for target port (80) and IP
6. Go to Workloads - Pod - Select curlimage pod - Terminal
7. Try to do curl from the pod to service IP and port (80)
8. The service should be accessible with message: Hello from exercise3, you are doing a great job!
9. Go to Network - Routes - Check exercise3 routes - Look for target port (8080)
10. Edit route for exercise3 in yaml and update the target port into 80 - Save
11. Access the route URL and application should be accessible

=== Command line (CLI)
- Login to Openshift server API using the assigned user account with `oc` command if not logged in

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

- Go to assigned namespace-{user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc project namespace-{user}
----

3. Check the service details of exercise3 and get details for IP and Port (80) - oc describe svc exercise3
4. Go to the curlimage pod (oc rsh pod curlimage)
5. Curl the IP and port from service in the curlimage pod - The curl should be working (Hello from exercise3, you are doing a great job!) 
6. Check the route target port (oc describe route exercise3) - Wrong target port (8080)
7. Edit the route exercise3 target port to 80 (oc edit route exercise3 and change target port to 80)
8. Curl the route location for exercise3 (Hello from exercise3, you are doing a great job!)
