[#scenario]
= Additional disk unaccessible in Virtual Machine

== Scenario

The user is reporting that the additional disk in the `exercise5` virtual machine does not show up in the lists when running the `fdisk` or `lsblk` command. The user would like to create a disk named `exercise5-vol-data1` and mount it to the virtual machine named `exercise5`

NOTE: Your task is to troubleshoot and resolve the issue so that the `exercise5-vol-data1` disk is showing when the user runs the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_port}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.
