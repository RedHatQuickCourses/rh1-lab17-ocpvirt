= Additional disk unaccessible in Virtual Machine

== Scenario

User is reporting the additional disk in exercise5 virtual machine not showing in the lists when running fdisk or lsblk command.

Users would like to create a disk with the name exercise5-vol-data1 and mount it to the virtual machine.

NOTE: Your task is to troubleshoot and resolve the issue so that the exercise5-vol-data1 disk is showing when the user runs the lsblk or fdisk command.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise5
