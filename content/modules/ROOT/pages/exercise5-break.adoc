[#scenario]
= Additional disk unaccessible in Virtual Machine

== Scenario

The user is reporting that the additional disk in the `exercise5` virtual machine does not show up in the lists when running the `fdisk` or `lsblk` command. The user would like to create a disk named `exercise5-vol-data1` and mount it to the virtual machine named `exercise5`

NOTE: Your task is to troubleshoot and resolve the issue so that the `exercise5-vol-data1` disk is showing when the user runs the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion and OCP cluster as {user}

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
----

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise5
