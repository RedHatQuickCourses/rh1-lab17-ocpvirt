= Virtual Machine with performance degraded

== Scenario

In this scenario, a Virtual Machine named `exercise4` is currently in a Running state. The development team has reported performance issues with an application hosted on this VM.

Your task is to investigate the problem by analyzing the VMâ€™s resource usage, including CPU, memory, and other relevant metrics. You are permitted to adjust the VM's compute resources as needed to resolve the issue; however, a reboot is not permitted.

[NOTE]
====
* The goal is to identify bottlenecks or misconfigurations and implement optimizations to enhance the application's efficiency within the virtualized infrastructure.
* Do not kill any process running inside the virtual machine
* Do not reboot the virtual machine

.Command to check the CPU usage on Virtual Machine
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl ssh lab-user@exercise4 \
--command "top -b -n 1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print \$2 \"% Used\"}'"
----

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the OCP cluster, run the command to break the lab.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise4
----

=== Console
After the break, you can log in to the OpenShift web console using your username and password or continue using the `oc` Command line at bastion to begin the troubleshooting process.
