[#scenario]
= Virtual Machine with performance degraded

== Scenario

In this scenario, a Virtual Machine named `exercise4` is currently Running. The development team has reported a performance issue with an application hosted inside this VM.

Your task is to investigate the problem, starting with analyzing the VMâ€™s resource usage, including CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc. Adjusting Virtual Machine compute resources is allowed in this lab; however, `no reboot` is mandatory.

[NOTE]
====
* The goal is to identify bottlenecks or misconfigurations and implement optimizations to enhance the application's efficiency within the virtualized infrastructure.
* Do not kill any process running inside the virtual machine
* Do not reboot the virtual machine

.Command to check the CPU usage on Virtual Machine
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
virtctl ssh lab-user@exercise4 --command "top -b -n 1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print \$2 \"% Used\"}'"
----

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, ensure you are logged in to the bastion with password `{bastion_ssh_password}` and OpenShift cluster as user `{user}`.

.SSH command to bastion
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "gcp"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname}
endif::[]

ifeval::["{cloud_provider}" == "openshift_cnv"]
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
endif::[]
----

.bastion Password
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{bastion_ssh_password}
----

.OpenShift login command
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

Once connected to the bastion host and OCP cluster run the command to break the lab.

.Breaking the exercise
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise4
----

=== Console
After the break, you can log in to the OpenShift web console using your username and password or continue using the `oc` command line at bastion to begin the troubleshooting process.
