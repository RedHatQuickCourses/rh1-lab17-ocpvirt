=  Virtual Machine is not starting - part 1

== Scenario

The user is trying to deploy and starting the VM but failed to run.

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

{ssh_command}

[source,role=execute]
{ssh_command}

Once connected to the bastion host log in OCP cluster

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
{login_command}
```

run the command to break the lab

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise1
```
