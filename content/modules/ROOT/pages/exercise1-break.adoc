[#scenario]
= Virtual Machine is not starting

== Scenario

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `bastion_url` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal, access SSH the node `bastion_url` using `userX` (where X is the number of your user) 

```
ssh userX@bastion_url
```

Once connected to the bastion host run the command lab to break the lab.

```
lab break exercise1
```
