NOTE: The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal on right side, access the bastion node using SSH.


[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
----

Once connected to the bastion host log in OCP cluster

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{login_command}
----

run the command to break the lab

[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
lab break exercise1
----
