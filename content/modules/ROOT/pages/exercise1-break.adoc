=  Virtual Machine is not scheduling - part 1

== Scenario

The primary goal in this scenario is to investigate the cause of the failure and take corrective action to bring `exercise1` virtual machine `Running` state again.
Your task is to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

== Executing the lab script

In this exercise setup, you first need to access the bastion trough `{bastion_public_hostname}` to gain entry into the lab environment. From the terminal on right side, access SSH the node bastion.

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
ssh {user}@{bastion_public_hostname} -p {bastion_ssh_port}
```

Once connected to the bastion host log in OCP cluster

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
{login_command}
```

run the command to break the lab

[source,sh,role=execute]
```
lab break exercise1
```
